          <b>Scope:</b><br />
          Unless indicated otherwise the standard terms of business apply to
          customers seeking or holding Swadeshi Standard Certification Private
          Limited (“SSC”). <br />

          <b>Fee structure and definitions:</b><br />
          The price list that is effective from 1st August, 2020 is on page
          ______ of this document. Our prices are reviewed annually and are
          subject to amendment at any time.<br />

          <b>Application Fee:</b><br />
          The first step when seeking accreditation is to submit a completed
          application form and the application fee so that we can begin
          consideration of the applicant’s readiness for accreditation. The fee
          is payable in advance of the application review process and is not
          refundable if the applicant withdraws.<br />

          <b>Pre-assessment and Initial Assessment Work:</b><br />
          Pre-assessment or initial assessment work is that required for the
          grant of accredited status under a standard separate from any
          currently held. Surveillance and Reassessment Work Once accredited,
          customers will be provided with a four-year programme giving an
          estimate of the quantity of effort for office, assessment, overseas
          travel and measurement audit work (where applicable). Thereafter,
          customers will be advised of any revised effort brought about by, for
          example, an extension to scope. All other work, including the
          clearance of any nonconformity identified as a result of an
          assessment, referred to as “close out effort” by SSC, whether this
          involves extra visits or not, will be subject to an additional charge
          over and above the quotation. Your assessment manager will advise you
          of the additional time to be charged during or reasonably soon after
          the assessment visit.<br />

          <b>Extension to Scope:</b><br />
          Organisations wishing to extend their accreditation must complete an
          appropriate application form for the appropriate category available
          from our web-site. Additional assessor, expert or administration time
          will be required to process and assess an extension to scope and a
          separate charge will be made.<br />

            <li>
              <b>Technical Assessment Resource Supplement:</b><br />
              Where a customer’s speciality or other circumstances require us to
              use specialist assessors or experts with a day rate above £600 per
              person per day, we reserve the right to pass on to the customer
              any excess charges we incur. Measurement Audits and
              non-accreditation work Measurement audit assessments (relevant to
              calibration laboratories) will be charged at the standard day rate
              per person based on the time spent. In addition, the use of
              measurement audit artefacts will be charged at a fixed
              administration charge for use of each item, based on the original
              cost, including maintenance, of the artefact. Other
              non-accreditation related work will be priced individually.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Units of Time:</b><br />
              Rates for our services will be calculated in days, half days or
              quarter days per person. We will not bill our time for journeys
              wholly within the India. If the working day is unduly prolonged,
              an additional half or quarter day per person may be charged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Travel Rechargeable Time:</b><br />
              Total travel time to reach assessment destinations outside of the
              India and/or offshore work which is based in the India will be
              charged at the relevant day rate in days, half days or quarter
              days per person. For the purposes of calculating total travel
              rechargeable time, the India will include the Crown Dependencies
              where the total travel time is less than 3 hours. SSC reserves the
              right to charge for travel time for an assessment resource to
              travel from outside of the India to conduct an assessment in the
              India, where that assessment resource is specifically required by
              the customer.<br />
              Trapped weekend days are not generally billed. However, assessment
              team expenses for trapped days will be billed (see page 7 for
              current Travel & Subsistence rate).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Annual Accreditation Fee:</b><br />
              Apart from the fees for assessment work above, some organisations
              will be subject to an annual accreditation fee. For information on
              when this charge will be applicable and how it will be charged
              please refer to the price list on page 7.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Expenses:</b><br />
              See details in the price list on page 7.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Scheduling of visits:</b><br />
              Customers are assigned a profile month in which their assessment
              (or bulk thereof) will be conducted: In the case of witness
              assessments, e.g. for certification bodies, these will be assigned
              a profile year. SSC will endeavour to provide customers with more
              than one option for visit dates but where this proves difficult
              due to technical resource availability, customers will be required
              to accept the visit dates set by SSC to ensure the level of
              surveillance required for the maintenance of a customer’s
              accreditation can be provided.<br />
              SSC will advise customers of their profile month at the point of
              granting accreditation and annually thereafter in the letter to
              the customer confirming their maintenance of accreditation.
              Customers are expected to plan resources accordingly as part of
              their proactive preparation for a visit. Customers are responsible
              for coordinating witness assessment visits that cover their full
              scope of accreditation and are required to contact the SSC
              customer liaison team to provide suitable dates ideally 3 to 4
              months in advance of a site assessment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cancellation Policy and Charges:</b><br />
              Where the customer cancels or postpones the date of a visit after
              it has been agreed, a fee may be payable as set out below.<br />
              Surveillance and reassessment visits will normally be agreed and
              booked with the customer three or more months in advance. Other
              assessments, including witnessed assessments associated with
              surveillance and reassessment visits may be booked at shorter
              notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reinstatement Fee:</b><br />
              Where a customer’s accreditation is suspended for financial
              reasons e.g. late payment of invoices, a fee will be charged for
              reinstating the accreditation when the debt has been settled (see
              price list on page 7).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Quotations:</b><br />
              Customers will be provided a quotation before work begins and are
              required to confirm their acceptance of the quotation within 14
              days of the date of issue. Once work has started, the customer is
              deemed to have accepted the quotation and is committed to paying
              for the quoted quantity of effort and any expenses. Although we
              will endeavour to carry out the job within the effort allowed by
              the quotation, we reserve the right to agree and bill for a
              different quantity if this is what is actually worked.
              Accordingly, it is in the customers’ interests to ensure that
              their records and evidence are of the agreed standard. Any
              nonconformities that are identified during an assessment will
              require additional effort, referred to by SSC as “Close out
              effort”, and therefore will result in additional charges.
              Quotations for “Close out effort” will usually be sent after the
              site visit when the effort required becomes known. Late submission
              of Evidence against nonconformities The date for submitting
              evidence will be agreed between the customer and the assessment
              manager during the closing meeting of an assessment. The
              cancellation policy will apply where a customer submits evidence
              in relation to nonconformities later than the agreed dates, i.e.
              evidence submitted late may be treated as a “cancellation” where
              time set aside by SSC for the review of such evidence cannot be
              reallocated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Invoicing:</b><br />
              Invoices are raised in sterling and are due and payable in full,
              are raised in electronic format and sent via email, and may be
              raised in stages, for example for lengthy projects or in relation
              to overseas work where SSC incurs substantial travel costs in
              advance of the visit. Value Added Tax will be applied according to
              India rules. Any non-India taxes and all other transaction charges
              relating to the payment remain the responsibility of the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Payment Terms:</b><br />
              For India customers, our standard payment terms are 30 days from

              will be due and payable without any right of further explanation,
              amendment or dispute. We have a statutory right under the Late
